            <div class="body">This system with fittings and pipes for compressed air is made of high quality PE 100 blue material. Besides a large number of fittings, which are available with or without metal threads, and corrosion resistant pipes, AGRUAIR also includes valves and installation accessories. These PE 100 products, which are produced on state-of-the-art machines, not only impress with great customer satisfaction in universal compressed air applications, but also guarantee operating safety for many years. What is particularly worthy of note is the system's resilience against compressor oils, which can cause problems for other materials. AGRUAIR piping systems are available in a dimension range of between 20 mm and 110 mm; they support compressed air supplies in many industrial applications. Such as in automotive, foodstuffs and mining.

              <div class="body-title">PEHD/LLDPE Liners</div>
                Liners made of HDPE and LLDPE are characterised by great resilience and toughness. The main applications are in mining, landfills, water reservoirs, wastewater reservoirs and secondary containment. AGRU liners are also used in exposed places, such as water reservoirs for snowing systems. The specific sealing requirements in terms of best-in-class flexibility with optimum strength and elongation behaviour accompanied by excellent chemical resistance are state-of-the-art at AGRU. Additionally, a long service life is a fundamental requirement for liners being able to do their job in the long term. These excellent properties have helped HDPE and LLDPE liners by AGRU to establish themselves in a variety of applications for many years.

              <div class="body-title">AGRUFLEX FPP and VLDPE</div>
                AGRUFLEX is AGRU's brand for highly-flexible liners made of FPP and VLDPE raw materials. These materials are polymers with highest flexibility which, in contrast to PVC, do not contain plasticisers that diffuse over the course of time. This means that properties such as flexibility and high tear resistance are not impacted over the entire service life. Our AGRUFLEX geomembranes ensure an ecologically and economically meaningful implementation of your project. FPP liners have a lower heat expansion coefficient than PE-based materials; they are more resistant against puncturing and more resilient against stress cracking. Due to these properties, these liners are perfectly suited for sealing all kinds of ponds. FPP liners are offered in widths of 5 m. They are also additionally available in 2 m widths with a glass fibre reinforcement. This prevents heat expansion to a great extent, thus avoiding temperature related folds. VLDPE liners are also used for sealing pools and swimming ponds can be produced in widths of up to 5 m. They are characterised by their excellent flexibility and easy installation.

              <div class="body-title">AGRUFLEX VLDPE Tunnel Liners</div>
                VLDPE is used globally for lining tunnels today. This prevents groundwater entering the tunnel. Besides the loads that occur including rock settling and shifting, aggressive rock water must always be anticipated. Tunnel liners are thus exposed to high mechanical and chemical stress, and specially designed by AGRU for the use in tunnels. Because VLDPE does not contain diffusing plasticisers, the liner's optimum properties of flexibility and high tear resistance do not change throughout the liner's entire service life. All tunnel liners are made with a thin white signal layer which is affixed in a coextrusion process. This can indicate damage during installation, because the black carrier layer is revealed. And the white signal layer improves safety substantially in the tunnel by reflecting existing light and thus improving the illumination in the tunnel. AGRU's state-of-the-art production equipment is capable of extruding VLDPE tunnel liners in up to 4 m widths. They can be fleece backed for special applications. It is also possible to equip tunnel liners with electrically conductive layers for leak monitoring.

              <div class="body-title">Relax</div>
                The RELAX pool liner is a highly-flexible, premium quality and robust thermoplastic liner for pools on PE basis. The first plasticiser-free plastic liners on the market are characterised in particular by their longevity and toughness. The visually appealing material is available in the colours light blue, azure blue, grey, and white. RELAX is non-hazardous to health, environmentally friendly and does not impact the water quality.

              <div class="body-title">Drainage Systems</div>
                As a system supplier, AGRU not only offers geomembranes, but also drainage pipes and drainage composites. Drainage pipes are extruded from PE 100 and PP on AGRU's state-of-the-art production equipment. Drain pipes can be perforated or slotted directly during the extrusion process; the inlet size and pattern are tailored to meet the project-specific requirements in each case. In addition to our drainage pipes we offer a comprehensive system of PE pipes and fittings. AGRU's drainage composite are part of the AGRUDRAIN product group. They comprise a three-dimensional, extruded, wave-shaped polypropylene drain core. The core can be backed with different kinds of geotextile on one or both sides.

              <div class="body-title">AGRULOCK</div>
                Pollution due to emissions of contaminants from abandones waste dumps and insufficiently sealed landfills often lead to irreparable impact on the soil and groundwater. Vertical barriers can be used to effectively contain landfills and abandoned sites. This enables to control and treat contaminated water, thus preventing more contaminats being emitted. AGRULOCK is a special product for setting up vertical barriers. The system consits of HDPE geomembranes which are welded to AGRU's specially developed profiles. These prefabricated liner sections are then lowered into pits filled with a bentonite suspension. AGRULOCK profiles are used to connect the individual sections, thus creating a vertical barrier around the contaminated site. The AGRULOCK system has been successfully installed in a number of projects, thus effectively demonstrating its reliability and practical capability in containment projects.

              <div class="body-title">Welding Rods</div>
                Depending on the product and laying technique, plastic liners are permanently joined and sealed using a variety of welding methods. Besides hot wedge welding and hot air welding, extrusion welding is used in particular. AGRU offers welding rods specially designed and tested for each product. This enables reliable extrusion welds.
